# listen_ip and list_port define the ip address and port the proxy will listen to.

# EXPERIMENTAL
# If a block has been pruned by bitcoind, a download for the missing block will be initiated. 
# wait_for_download lets you configure the amount of seconds to wait for the download, before
# trying to return the (hopefully then downloaded) block. 
# If the download has NOT finished or wait_for_download is set to 0, the regular error message
# from bitcoind (missing/pruned block) will be forwarded after the block download was initiated.
# lightningd will retry the block download every seconds
# (see lightnind's log file) until it succeeds, which is usually after a few seconds/retries, when
# the block was downloaded from the network.
# lightningd has a timeout of 10 seconds for the getblock request, so anything below 10 will help
# reduce the amount of requests forwarded to bitcoind and keep the lightningd log file clean.
# Default:
# wait_for_download = 0
